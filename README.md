# description
Basic local todo with state and rendering seperated and served using static express

# Why classes ?
The only counter to using classes was performance but I don't need inheritance and i like how it organises the code so I went for them.

# Why JS in HTML
The application was fairly simple and more of a proof that I can do things for a potential employer rather than a clean professional project so I made it simple to understand at a glance (everything in one file)
